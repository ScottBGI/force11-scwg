## Notes
- Introductions of all participants, please list your name here:
    - Matt Jones, Abby Cabunoc Mayes, Alexander Konovalov, Ashley Sands, Brian Matthews, Chris Erdmann, David Baker, Fiona Murphy, Scott Edmunds, Stephanie Haegstrom, Thomas Ingraham, Carl Boettiger, Dan Katz, Jennifer Lin, Martin Fenner, John Kratz, Lars Holm Nielsen, Bob Hanisch

- Apologies:
    - Mercè Crosas, Martin Fenner, Neil Chue Hong, James Howison, Daniel Mietchen, Bill Mills, Karthik Ram, Jonathan Tedds, Kaitlin Thaney, Tom Crick

- Mission statement: relatively stable
    - Audience for our work:
    - editors / reviewers
    - Is that too small, any suggestions?
    - End-users of the software (I think that was mentioned during the meeting) scientists, computer scientists, library staff, etc.
    - policy makers and research evaluators/creditors (e.g. UK REF).
    - Funders: ie, Sloan Foundation
    - Publishers ? (for example: to ensure that the bibliography style used in a journal correctly handles BibTeX entries describing software and does not omit critical information)
    - What about providers of research software citation databases: e.g. from my area, http://www.swmath.org/ is a really good example. What does exist in other domains?  
    - Reference management software– need to be able to get into Zotero, EndNote, etc. easily  (there has been discussion on this on x-biblio mailing list recently which is responsible for CSL style. Next major version will have "computer program" as work type, so that citation styles can use this info. Zotero, Mendeley, Papers already have computer program work type internally)
    - Software developers - share examples of good practices in suggesting how to cite their software to users (e.g. CITATION file, functions to generate citations in common formats etc)

- What do Force 11 groups produce?
    - defined by group, groups can transition (disband, reconvence), ultimately can publish one product then can transition to next phase with new group
- Goal: set of software citation principles, to be presented at Force16
- For data principles, candidate set of priorities were sent to community, which was already active and engaged heavily in comments
    - WG convened every other week to address all comments for every principle
- Stephanie: suggests our group come up with guiding principles to start the community discussion
- Matt: Can we start from the data citation principles, and see how software differs from there?
    - Force11 data principles: https://www.force11.org/group/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-final
    - Yes! No reason for us to start from scratch. However, just a small warning to not be too attached to the world of data. For example, there is a lot of concern wtih using the phrase "data publication" as it assumes that data are published the same as literature. In the same way, we should be careful to not be too focused on the similarities with the data analogy that we miss what is actually most important about software, and it may not be parallel at all to data. We'll see :)
    - One approach would be to start with our own principles to not be prejudiced, and look at the data citation principles only later

- POTENTIAL VENUES FOR IN-PERSON MEETING:
    - Proposal to meet in person to work on principles on Sep 28/29 at WSSSPE3 in Boulder, CO
        - http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe3/
        - Could be one of the working tasks for WSSSPE3
        - Planning to attend: 
            - Arfon
            - Dan
            - Neil

    - Also could consider: Software Credit Workshop, 19 October 2015 in London: http://www.software/ac.uk/software-credit (it's only one day on Monday, so perhaps we may need an extra half a day before or maybe better after that) 
        - Planning to attend:
            - Alexander
            - Arfon
            - Maybe Dan (but if so, cannot be available on 20 Oct)
            - Neil
            - Tom Crick
            - Maybe Fiona Murphy
    - And also SC15 (Supercomputing) — November 15-20, 2015 — Austin, TX
        - Planning to attend:
            - Dan
            - Neil
    - RDA, Paris also another venue; 23rd-25th September https://rd-alliance.org/plenary-meetings/rda-sixth-plenary-meeting.html
        - Planning to attend:
            - Daniel
            - Fiona Murphy
            - John Kratz
    - Ashley: ASIST is another candidate, November 2015 http://www.asis.org/asist2015/am15cfp.html


- OTHER COMMENTS
    - Catherine Jones:18:00: All, I haven't joined the call, but am looking at this. What about software repositories providers?
        - Not just the companies, but institutions/organisations who provide them for communities


- NEXT STEPS:
    - Email from Arfon (and Dan) to come out
    - Async discussion of principles
    - Drafting of firm principles in Github, but use Google Docs for commentary
