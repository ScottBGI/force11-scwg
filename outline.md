## Motivation

Introduce the document by describing the motivations for producing a consolidated set of software citation principles. This section is basically an overview of the different use cases/scenarios where it would be desirable to have a way to cite software.

## Related work

In this section we discuss related work in the community including the relationship of this work to the Force11 Data Citation Principles. This is basically an overview of the documentation phased we went through as a group and will be heavily based on the collection of summaries we have of existing practices.

## Software citation principles

This section states for the first time the core software citation principles/architecture together with justification for each. The justification will likely be framed in a way such that it addresses the requirements as stated in the initial discussion of use cases/scenarios we wish to support.

## Implementation examples and recommendations

For a subset (all?) of the use cases we then demonstrate how different stakeholders could adhere to/become compliant with the software citation principles. 

This section is designed to offer explicit guidance for community members who wish to implement the software citation principles in their domain.
