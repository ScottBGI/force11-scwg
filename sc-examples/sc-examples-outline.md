# Software Citation Example Paper

In this document we would like to outline the paper on examples of software
citation, which should build on the software citation principles paper with
some practical examples of software citation in a few typical use cases.

## Examples

### Citing software with a provided DOI

In this case, the software developers archived a version of the software used
by the paper authors and provide all the recommended metadata.

Example

### Citing software hosted on GitHub

In this case, the software to be cited is hosted on GitHub, with discrete
versions released.

It may also be the case that the version of the software used is not associated
with an explicit release/version number, but instead a specific git commit.

### Citing commercial software or other closed-source software

Frequently commercial or otherwise closed-source software needs to be cited.
In this case, the version (or associated release date) combined with
information about how the software may be obtained should be provided (e.g.,
URL, contact email address).

Example 1: URL

    COMSOL Inc., COMSOL Multiphysics. version 4.3b, May 2013. https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics

Example 2: email address

### Citing software that is only available as a service

Some software is only available as a service.  This is similar to closed-source software,
except that the service is availale at a URL, and perhaps may be the subject of a paper.
